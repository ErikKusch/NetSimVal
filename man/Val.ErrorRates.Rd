\title{Network Inference Error Rates Validation}
\usage{
Val.ErrorRates(Network1, Network2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Network1}{igraph object. True network in comparison.}

\item{Network2}{igraph object. Inferred network in comparison.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing percentages and error rate types:
\itemize{
\item TP ... true positive associations; how many of the inferred positive associations are correctly identified as such? - NaN means no positives in the inferred matrix
\item TN ... true negative associations; how many of the inferred negative associations are correctly identified as such? - NaN means no negatives in the inferred matrix
\item TA ... true absent; how many of the inferred absent interactions are correctly identified as such? - NaN means no absents in the inferred matrix
\item FP ... falsely inferred positive; how many of the inferred positive associations are incorrectly identified as such?
\item FN ... falsely inferred negative; how many of the inferred negative associations are incorrectly identified as such?
\item FA ... false absent; how many of the inferred absent interactions are correctly identified as such?
\item MP ... true positive links which were not inferred; how many of the true positive associations were not inferred?
\item MN ... true negative links which were not inferred; how many of the true negative associations were not inferred?
\item MA ... true absent links which were not inferred; how many of the true absent associations were not inferred?
}
}
\description{
Calculate accuracy of network inference by sign of underlying true link.
